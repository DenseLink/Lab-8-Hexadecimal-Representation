# Lab 8: Hexadecimal Representation

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation for Lab 8, focused on hexadecimal representation and color conversion. The project demonstrates handling hexadecimal values in C++ and applying them in the context of color representations.

## Contents

- `Color.cpp` & `Color.h`: Core implementation files defining the `Color` class, which encapsulates functionality for color representation and conversion between different formats.
- `main.cpp` & `main.h`: Driver code demonstrating the usage of the `Color` class, including examples of converting and handling colors in hexadecimal format.
- `colors1.txt` & `colors2.txt`: Sample input files containing color definitions used by the application.
- `Lab 8.pdf`: Documentation and lab instructions detailing the objectives, requirements, and steps to follow for completing the lab exercise.
- `Lab 8 - Number Conversion.zip`: A compressed archive containing all the project files, useful for easy download and distribution.
